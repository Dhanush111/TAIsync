# Merge Sorted Arrays

Problem





Given two sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array in ascending order.





Input Format



The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m, the sizes of arrays A and B. The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the elements of array A. The third line contains m space-separated integers representing the elements of array B.





Output Format



Print space-separated integers representing the merged sorted array.
