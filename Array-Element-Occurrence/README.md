# Array Element Occurrence

Problem





Design a program that reads an array of N integer values and prints the occurrence of all elements in the array.





Input Format



The first line contains a single integer N, the number of elements in the array. 



The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.





Output Format



For each unique element in the array, print the element followed by a colon and the number of occurrences of that element in the array. Each element and its count should be printed on a new line in the order that element first appears in the array.
