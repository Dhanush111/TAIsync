# Even Odd Frequency

Problem





Develop a program that reads an array of integers and prints all the even elements that occur an odd number of times.





Input Format



The first line contains a single integer N, the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains N space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array.





Output Format



Print the even integers that occur an odd number of times in the array, each on a new line. If an even number is found to occur an odd number of times, it should be printed only once, in the order it first appears. If no even numbers repeating odd times print “No Repeating Elements”.
