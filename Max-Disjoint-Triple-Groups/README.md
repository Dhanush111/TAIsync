# Max Disjoint Triple Groups

Problem





Write a program that reads an array of N integers and calculates the maximum number of disjoint groups that can be formed.





Input Format



The first line contains a single integer N, the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains N space-separated integers, the elements of the array.





Output Format



Print a single integer, the maximum number of disjoint groups with at least one element repeating three times that can be formed from the array.
