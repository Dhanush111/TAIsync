# Repeated Elements in Two Sorted Arrays

Problem


Find the repeated elements in two sorted arrays.


Input Format

The input consists of four lines:

An integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5), representing the number of elements in array A.

N space-separated integers, denoting the elements of array A in Ascending order.

An integer M (1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5), representing the number of elements in array B in descending order.

M space-separated integers, denoting the elements of array B.


Output Format

Print the elements that are repeated in both arrays A and B, in ascending order, separated by a space.
