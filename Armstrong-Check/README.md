# Armstrong Check

Problem





Given a positive integer N, check whether it is an Armstrong number or not.





Input Format



An integer N (1 <= N <= 10^9) representing the input number.





Output Format



Print "Armstrong" if N is an Armstrong number, and "Not Armstrong" otherwise.

Explanation for Armstrong Number:



An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153. Similarly, 370 is an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3 = 370. A single digit number is always an Armstrong number because it satisfies the condition trivially (e.g., 5 is an Armstrong number because 5^1 = 5).
