# Repeated Elements in Two Sorted Arrays

Problem


Find and print the elements that are repeated in both given sorted arrays.


Input Format

The input consists of four lines:

An integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5), representing the number of elements in array A.

N space-separated integers, denoting the elements of array A 

An integer M (1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5), representing the number of elements in array B

M space-separated integers, denoting the elements of array B.


Output Format

Print the repeated elements from both arrays in ascending order, separated by a space.
